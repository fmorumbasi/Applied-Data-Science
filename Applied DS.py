from static_grader import grader


# # IN Miniproject
# 
# The objective of this miniproject to teach you about our grading system.  We will do this by solving two easy problems.  
# 
# Our grader is a custom bit of code that needs to imported as above in order to work.  Questions are scored by calling `grader.score.question_name(answer)`.  The `question_name` method be different for each question, and will be provided for you.  The form of `answer` will vary question to question.  Sometimes you will be asked to submit a fixed value; other times you will be asked to submit a function which will compute something based on some (hidden) input.
# 
# Your answer will be graded automatically and the score returned to you on a 0 to 1 scale. (Sometimes you can do even better than 1!)   We will count your highest grade, so feel free to try out different solutions!

# # Problem 1
# 
# Compute the five smallest positive even numbers.  Provide these in a list.
# 
# In this case, the answer is a fixed value, so you may compute (or hard-code) the answer and submit it.
# Note that we have provided a "dummy solution" below. This dummy solution illustrates the correct format of the solution (i.e. a list of 5 numbers). If you are encountering an error when you try to submit a solution to the grader, double check that your answer has the same structure as the dummy solution.

# In[ ]:


even_numbers = [0] * 5


# In[ ]:


print (even_numbers)


# In[ ]:


grader.score.in__problem1(even_numbers)


# # Problem 2
# 
# Define a function that accepts a list (called `numbers` below) as input and return a list where each element is multiplied by 10. The grader will supply the argument `numbers` to the function when you run the `grader.score.in__problem2` method below.
# 
# In this case, you need to write a function that will work for arbitrary input.
# Before submitting your function to the grader, you may want to check that it returns the output that you expect by evaluating code similar to the following:
# 
# ```python
# 
# test_numbers = [1, 2, 3]
# mult(test_numbers)
# ```

# In[ ]:


def mult(numbers):
    return [0] * len(numbers)


# In[ ]:


grader.score.in__problem2(mult)
